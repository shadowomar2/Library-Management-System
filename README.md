There is sawagger GUI to try the API's http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html 

There are Javadoc for documentation publishing in this link: https://shadowomar2.github.io/Library-Management-System

Note: There is JWT authentication active in this branch so the test can't be run ,
But in line 62 in WebSecurityConfig you can change the permissions for api to active test cases.
